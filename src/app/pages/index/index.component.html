                            Right now, no matter where you live in the world, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is
                            likely forcing changes to your everyday life. The same is true for businesses of all
                            stripes, who have had to adjust on the fly as restrictions are put into place to slow the
                            spread of the outbreak. In the process, much of the global economy has ground to a halt.

                            research about how the brain learns, including such factors as cognitive development—how
                            students learn differently as they age, grow, and mature socially, emotionally, and
                            cognitively.”
